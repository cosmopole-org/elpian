detect the returning details inside the input which i give you and put it in a
structure like below and just output it only:
{
    "type": "returnOperation",
    "data": {
        "value": "{{ can be an expression (basic or complex) which can consist of a nested operation between Val types, functionCalls or arithmetics like explained }}",
    }
}

the input is:

    - return the result of (variable a + 1)

just output the result.
